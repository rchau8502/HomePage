## Rich's Homepage

This is my space on the web: <https://rchau8502.github.io/HomePage/>. It's a living journal of what
I'm building, how my skills evolve, and the vibes that inspire me. No templates, no
instructions—just a showcase of my work.

### What you'll see

- **Hero snapshot** telling you who I am and what I'm focused on.
- **Highlights** showing proof of progress (commits, shipped experiments, community updates).
- **Skill map** that links to the dedicated stack page.
- **Timeline** with yearly milestones.
- **Connect** block with GitHub, Instagram, and my headphone-wearing cat mascot.
