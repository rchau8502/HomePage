## Rich's Homepage

This is my space on the web: <https://rchau8502.github.io/HomePage/>. It's a living journal of what
I'm building, how my skills evolve, and the vibes that inspire me. 

### Current tools

| Daily drivers                 | Learning now                | On deck            |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------ |
| HTML, CSS, Python, Java       | JavaScript, TypeScript, Rust| Elixir, C#, Go     |
| C++, PowerShell, design tools | Kotlin, motion/2D animation | Clojure, more R&D  |

Outside of coding I tinker with Premiere/After Effects/Photoshop, groove through playlists, and
share snippets on Discord (`RichC02`).
