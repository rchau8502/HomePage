## Rich's Homepage

This repo powers my personal homepage and skill showcase: <https://hau6.top>. Everything in the site
is plain HTML + CSS so you can inspect or remix it easily.

### What’s inside

- **Sticky hero + jump nav** for fast access to About, Now, Journey, Notes, Connect, and Skills.
- **Now board** that broadcasts what I’m building, learning, and documenting right now.
- **Projects + timeline cards** spotlight the evolving skills list, a public build journal, and key
  milestones from each year.
- **Notes panel** summarizing design decisions, like the switch to a light “Miku blue” palette and
  layered gradients.
- **Connect section** with GitHub, Instagram, email links, and my headphone-wearing cat mascot.

### Stack

- `index.html`
- `styles.css` (custom properties for the aqua theme, responsive grid utilities)

No frameworks, bundlers, or build steps.

### Develop locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rchau8502/HomePage.git
cd HomePage
start index.html  # Windows
# or: open index.html in your favorite browser
```

Edit the HTML/CSS, refresh the browser, and commit once things feel right.
